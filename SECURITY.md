## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this is a personal website with no sensitive information contained, I am fine with vulnerabilities being disclosed as [Issues](https://github.com/evanextreme/website/issues). If you would like to disclose it privately, you can email me at [evan@ehirsh.com](mailto:evan@ehirsh.com).
